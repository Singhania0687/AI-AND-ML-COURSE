🧠 Lesson 1: What is AI?

💡 Definition:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines. These systems are built to mimic human actions such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making.

📚 Types of AI:

Type	     Description

Narrow AI	Specialized in one task (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, facial recognition)
General AI	Hypothetical system with human-level intelligence (not yet achieved)
Super AI	Beyond human intelligence (theoretical and futuristic)


🔍 AI Applications:

Domain	Application Example
Healthcare	Disease prediction, X-ray classification
Finance	Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
E-commerce	Recommendation systems
Robotics	Industrial robots, autonomous vehicles
Education	AI tutors, grading systems
Agriculture	Yield prediction, crop monitoring
🤖 What is Machine Learning (ML)?

💡 Definition:

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

📘 Types of Machine Learning:
Type	Description	Examples
Supervised Learning	Learn from labeled data	Email spam detection, regression
Unsupervised Learning	Learn from unlabeled data	Customer segmentation
Reinforcement Learning	Learn by interacting with environment via reward	Game-playing agents, robotics
